Financial Stability Indicators </a> </h3>

<i><medium> With Cristina Checherita-Westphal (ECB) and Othman Bouabdallah (ECB)
</medium></i>

<p> The aim of this paper is to examine the extent to which the dynamics in and
characteristics of a country’s financial sector anticipate subsequent
deteriorations in the country’s fiscal positions. Specifically, the paper
studies the ability of a broad range of financial stability indicators to
predict fiscal stress periods within one-year forecasting horizon.  </p>

<h3> <a href="http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jfi.2013.23.2.027"> Are
Credit Rating Announcements Contagious? Evidence on the Transmission of
Information Across Industries in Credit Default Swap Market </a> </h3>
<i><medium> Published in the Journal of Fixed Income (Fall 2013, Vol. 23, No. 2: pp. 27–60,

<p>
This paper studies the information content of bank accounting fundamental data
in the prediction of bank distress using an international sample of banks from
15 Western European countries and the U.S. during the financial crisis of
2007-12.The aim of this paper is to empirically test for the presence of
intra-industry informational transfers (IIIT) induced by rating signals in the
markets for corporate credit risk. In particular, we study the intra-industry
CDS spread responses to credit rating announcements made by S&P, Moody’s, and
Fitch between January 2003 and March 2011.
