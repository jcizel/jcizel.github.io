<p class="teaser" itemprop="description">
I am financial economist and data scientist, currently in my  final year of Ph.D. in Finance at Tinbergen Institute and
the VU University in Amsterdam. I am also a recipient of the <a
href="http://www.nwo.nl/actueel/nieuws/2012/MozaÃ¯ek-toekenningen+bij+MaGW.html"> NWO Mozaiek
research grant </a> (200,000 Euros) from the <a href="http://www.nwo.nl"> Netherlands Organization for Scientific
Research (NWO) </a>. My research covers a broad range of topics in <u>financial stability
issues, bank regulation, bank disclosure, credit risk, and early-warning systems.
</u></p>

<p class="teaser" itemprop="description"> Throughout the last couple of years, I
worked at a number of leading policy institutions and international
organizations, including: <u>International Monetary Fund</u> (Monetary and Capital
Markets), <u>European Central Bank</u> (DG-Economics, Fiscal Policies Division), 
<u> De Nederlandsche Bank </u> (Financial Stability Division), and the <u>European
Commission</u>. In 2014 I also visited the NYU Stern School of Business, where I was
working together with <a href="http://people.stern.nyu.edu/ealtman/"> Prof. Edward A. Altman</a> on early warning models for banks
and for sovereigns.  </p>
