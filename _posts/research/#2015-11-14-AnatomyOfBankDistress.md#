The analysis of our bank distress models reveals a substantial
cross-country variation in the ability of accounting fundamentals to
discriminate between distressed and non-distressed banks within countries. We
show that the association between accounting fundamentals and bank distress is
attenuated in jurisdictions with relatively lax bank disclosure laws and their
implementation. Accounting ratios, whose information value is the most sensitive
to the quality of regulatory disclosure include regulatory capital ratios, loan
loss provisions, and unreserved loan losses. The evidence in this paper supports
the oft-voiced concern that excessive flexibility in financial reporting
undermines the ability of accounting signals to accurately capture the
underlying financial health of banks. Obliqueness of the distressed s accounting
signals makes such information less useful for investors and regulators, and
thus has negative regulatory implications.
