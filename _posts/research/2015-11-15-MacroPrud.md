Macroprudential policy is increasingly being implemented worldwide. Key
questions are its effectiveness in influencing bank credit and substitution
effects beyond banking. Our results confirm the expected effects of
macroprudential policies on bank credit, both for advanced economies and
emerging market economies. But results also confirm substitution effects towards
non-bank credit, especially in advanced economies, reducing the policiesâ€™ effect
on total credit. Quantity-based measures are particularly potent in constraining
bank credit but also cause the strongest substitution effects. Policy
implications indicate a need to extend macroprudential policy beyond banking.
