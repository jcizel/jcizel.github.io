The widespread deterioration in fiscal conditions and debt sustainability of
many advanced economies following the Global Financial Crisis in 2007-09
highlighted the nexus between financial stability and fiscal
sustainability. Financial sector distress morphed into countries’ fiscal
deteriorations via direct channels due to fiscal costs associated with
government-sponsored financial sector assistance measures and automatic
stabilizers, as well as via indirect channels due to an adverse impact of credit
crunch on economic activity and on government revenues.


The aim of this paper is to examine the extent to which the dynamics in and
characteristics of a country’s financial sector anticipate subsequent
deteriorations in the country’s fiscal positions. Specifically, the paper
studies the ability of a broad range of financial stability indicators to
predict fiscal stress periods within one-year forecasting horizon. In line with
the prior literature on the early warning systems (e.g. Baldacci et al., 2011),
fiscal stress episodes are defined as periods in which a country is either in
default, experiences extreme market financing pressures, or is faced with high
levels of inflation. Using a signalling approach, popularized by the seminal
work of Kaminsky, Lizondo, and Reinhart (1998), the paper estimates critical
thresholds for a broad set of financial stability indicators, which cover
various dimensions of financial system health, including bank capitalization,
asset quality, profitability, and liquidity.


In the first stage of the analysis, the paper estimates critical thresholds and
assesses predictive content of more than 1200 different financial stability
indicators from various data sources including the IMF’s Financial Soundness
Indicators, World Bank’s Global Financial Development Database (Beck,
Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine 2010), as well as aggregated bank balance sheet and
income statement information from bank-level data in Bankscope. Critical
thresholds are estimated for various country sets, including Advanced Economies,
Eurozone, EU-28, and OECD countries. In the second stage, the paper ranks
indicators within each of the four country sets based on their predictive
content, and then proposes a group of top-ten performing financial stability
indicators. The results suggest that the top performing financial indicators are
predominantly the proxies of banks’ asset quality (e.g. fraction of corporate
and commercial loans in bank balance sheet, annual growth in bank assets, and
non-performing loans ratio) and bank profitability (bank return on equity,
dividend payout, and the spread between reference lending and deposit rates).

The key contribution of the paper lies in its comprehensive treatment of most
currently (publicly) available financial stability measures, which gives it a
unique vantage point for determining the best set of indicators to be used in
the context of predicting fiscal stress. This information can benefit fiscal
surveillance efforts, by allowing greater focus to be given to financial sector
indicators that have historically been most reliable predictors of impending
fiscal deteriorations.
