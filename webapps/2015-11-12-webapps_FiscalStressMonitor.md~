Basel III framework has introduced a number of important changes in the sphere
of bank regulation. Among others, it updated the existing capital regulation,
both in terms of capital and risk coverage, and introduced two new funding
liquidity ratios. We find that Basel III measures as a whole have only a small
incremental out-of-sample contribution in discriminating between distressed and
non-distressed banks, once we control for other traditionally used CAMEL and
macroeconomic variables. We do find, however, that liquidity coverage ratio and
risk weighted assets display marginally significant association with bank
distress. We also find that a high fraction of intangibles in bank capital
corresponds with higher vulnerability to distress.
